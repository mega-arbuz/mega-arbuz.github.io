If you feel that, for some reason, you want to contact me, you can do it via [GitHub](https://github.com/mega-arbuz). 
Anyway, I wanted to try some services that provide forms without backend, so here is the Contact Form.

[Go to the Home Page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }})

<script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>
<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="https://usebasin.com/f/4546b49d1a31" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="POST">
  <label for="email-address">Email Address</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

  <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="comment" required>
  </textarea>

  <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="6Lew3SMUAAAAAJ82QoS7gqOTkRI_dhYrFy1f7Sqy"></div>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
